# FormBuilder

FormBuilder is a Ruby gem that simplifies form creation in Ruby applications. It provides an easy-to-use API to generate HTML forms dynamically, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.

## Installation

To install FormBuilder, add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'form_generator'
```

Then, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Alternatively, you can install the gem manually with:

```bash
gem install form_generator
```

## Usage

FormBuilder provides a simple DSL for building HTML forms. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

```ruby
require 'form_generator'

user = { name: 'John Doe', bio: 'Software Developer' }

form_html = FormBuilder.form_for(user, url: '/submit') do |f|
f.input :name
f.input :bio, as: :text
end.to_s

puts form_html
```

## Output

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <input value="John Doe" />
  <textarea value="Software Developer"></textarea>
</form>
```
